**Guide**

1- Connect Gloves

2- Connect MIDI Interface (if additional control is wanted)

3- Open code on Arduino IDE

4- Run code while the hand is in a neutral position

5- Open the Serial Monitor to check if the calibration was done correctly

6- Close Serial Monitor

7- Open Max Patch and follow instructions

Steps 3-6 can be bypassed once the code is already stored in the Arduino. 
In that case, pressing the reset button on the board while holding the hand in a neutral position is advised.
