# How to build your own glove

## Required materials
- One glove (Suggested: lightweight material such as cotton, to not produce too much heat)
- 4 flex sensors
- Arduino Nano ESP32 board (Can be done with another ESP32 board, but will probably need some adjustments)
- Either:
-- Conductive thread and fabric
-- Multicore cable of different colours and stripboad
- Soldering iron, accesories to cut and peel cables
